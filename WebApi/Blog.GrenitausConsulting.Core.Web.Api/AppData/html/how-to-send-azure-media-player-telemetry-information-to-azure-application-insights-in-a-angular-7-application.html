On one of my engagements here at Microsoft, we helped a Client Partner implement several Azure Backend components related to Azure Media Services.  The Client Partner's Frontend Angular application requried the Azure Media Player to send telemetry information to <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/app-insights-overview" target="_blank">Azure Application Insights</a>.

<br><br>

In this blog I want to give a brief overview of the sample code I wrote that demonstrates how to send Azure Media Player telemetry information to <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/app-insights-overview" target="_blank">Azure Application Insights</a>.

<br><br>

You can find the code used in this blog on Github <a href="https://github.com/michaeldeongreen/angular7-amp-appinsights-demo" target="_blank">here</a>

<br><br>

<strong>Prerequisites!</strong>

<br><br>

<ul>
    <li>Access to the Azure Portal to view Telemetry information</li>
    <li>Angular 7</li>
    <li>Application Insights Asset and the Instrumentation Key</li>
</ul>

<br><br>

<strong>Overview!</strong>

<br><br>

The sample code is a basic Angular 7 Application that uses the Azure Media Player to stream sample media and send the telemetry information to Azure Application Insights.  For brevity, please review the <a href="https://github.com/michaeldeongreen/angular7-amp-appinsights-demo/blob/master/README.md" target="_blank">README.md</a> file, which provides a detailed breakdown of the <i>AmpDiagnosticsLoggerService</i>, which is a custom TypeScript library I created based upon the <a href="https://github.com/Azure-Samples/media-services-javascript-azure-media-player-diagnostic-logger-plugin/blob/master/amp-diagnosticsLogger.js" target="_blank">amp-diagnosticsLogger.js </a> JavaScript library that is responsible for sending Azure Media Player telemetry informaton to Azure Application Insights.

<br><br>

<strong>app.component.ts</strong>

<br><br>

<ul>
    <li>In *ngOnInit*, creates a list of custom <i>mezzanine</i> objects, which is just a custom interface with hardcoded values.</li>
    <li>In *ngAfterViewInit*, initializes the Azure Media Player that is embedded in <i>app.component.html</i></li>
    <li>In *ngAfterViewInit*, configures the <i>AmpDiagnosticsLoggerConfiguration</i> object and passes the object to the "Initialize" method in the <i>AmpDiagnosticsLoggerService</i> Service</li>.  See <a href="https://github.com/michaeldeongreen/angular7-amp-appinsights-demo/blob/master/README.md" target="_blank">README.md</a> file for details on the <i>AmpDiagnosticsLoggerConfiguration</i> and <i>AmpDiagnosticsLoggerService</i> classes</li>
    <li>setMovie method is called whenever the user clicks to play a movie.  When *setMovie* is called, the *log* method of the <i>AmpDiagnosticsLoggerConfiguration</i> service is called and the *mezzanine* id is passed.  This id will be set to the Application Insights <i>User Id</i> field.</li>
</ul>
 

<br><br>

<strong>app.component.html</strong>

<br><br>

The html template for <i>app.component.ts</i> displays an Azure Media Player and loop through the list of <i>mezzanine</i> objects and displays them on the screen.  When you click on either the Play picture or url, the <i>setMovie</i> method will be called and will be passed the current <i>mezzanine</i> object.  The video should start playing and Azure Media Player telmetry will be sent to Application Insights.
