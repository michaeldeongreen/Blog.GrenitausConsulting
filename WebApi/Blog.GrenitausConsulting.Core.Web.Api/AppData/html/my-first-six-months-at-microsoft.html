I blogged about my experience <a href="https://blog.michaeldeongreen.com/post/my-interview-with-microsoft" target="_blank">interviewing with Microsoft</a> roughly 6 months ago.  Even though it was a tough decision, I decided to give up the freedoms of Independent Consulting and join Microsoft.  I joined Microsoft about 6 months ago and I want to take some time to write about some of my experiences.

<br><br>

<strong>My Org!</strong>

<br><br>

The organization I work for within Microsoft is called <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/code-with-engineering-playbook/CSE.html" target="_blank">Commercial Software Engineering (CSE)</a>.  Microsoft is a company of companies and each organization tends to have a different culture, so my thoughts and observations are mainly based upon CSE, in particular CSE Dev Crews.

<br><br>

<strong>Misconceptions!</strong>

<br><br>

When I first joined Microsoft, I had several preconceived notions about the Microsoft Culture and the people who work here. 

<br><br>

<b>Arrogance!</b> - When I joined Microsoft, one of my biggest preconceived notions was that there were a lot of arrogant Type-A personalities.  As stated in my previous blog <a href="https://blog.michaeldeongreen.com/post/my-interview-with-microsoft" target="_blank">My Interview with Microsoft</a>, I had interviewed with Microsoft in the past and I felt the interviewers were a little arrogant.  

<br><br>

Also stated in my blog about interviewing with Microsoft, this belief started to be dispelled very early in the process.  In my first six months at Microsoft, I have not encountered a ton of arrogance.  Are there people here who have strong opinions and personalities?  Yes, but I haven't really come across anyone who I felt just thought they were better than everyone.  

<br><br>

To be fair, every company on earth has people that are arrogant and Microsoft is definitely not the exception (and I have been assured by co-workers they exist :) ), I just haven't come across a lot of it, like I thought I would before joining.


<br><br>

<b>Flamming!</b> - Another preconceived notion that I had about Microsoft when I first joined is that they had a culture of flamming.  At first, I was very hesitant to reach out to co-workers outside of my team (Dev Crews Dallas) if I had a question because I was worried that I would be flammed, derided and told that my question was stupid.

<br><br>

I think about month in, I final had the courage to ask a question on Microsoft Teams and something very interesting happened.  Not only did I not get flammed, but you want to know what my biggest problem became?  Having too many responses :).  Once you ask a question, you will get a bunch of responses and people will tend to say "I know how to do this, feel free to get on my calendar and I can walk you through it".

<br><br>

<b>Burning the Candle at Both Ends!</b> - Another major preconceived notion that I had about Microsoft is that working 60+ hours a week and having the "whip" cracked on you to meet tight deadlines was the norm.  I remember being in our Las Colinas Office until around 7 PM one day as I waited for traffic to settle down and being surprised that it was a ghost town around 6 PM.

<br><br>

Although I do know that there are organizations that probably work under constant tight deadlines, my experience has been the opposite.  Because of my consulting background and personality, I have a habit of "upskilling" on technology on weekends and after work hours.  I have been told on several occasions that this isn't necessary and even warned on a few occasions while on the road, not to go to the hotel and work :).

<br><br>

In CSE, they don't want you to work a lot of long hours because they don't want you to get burned out.  Also, technology is constantly changes and they realize you don't know everything, so when start to engage with our clients, time for "upskilling" on a new technology is expected and accounted for when estimates are given.

<br><br>

<strong>Adjustments!</strong>

<br><br>

I've been doing IT Consulting for the last 8 years (most of it 100% remote) and I was an Independent Contractor for about 2 of those 8 years, so naturally, I have had to make adjustments and at times, it has not been easy.

<br><br>

<b>Coming into an Office!</b> - On our team, we come in 3 times a week, Tuesday thru Thursday.  I actually live quite far from our office in Uptown Dallas, so it has been hard to adjust to having to come into an office when I had been 100% remote the last 5 or 6 years.  

<br><br>

Even though I still prefer having a office but going is optional and the commute are still tough, I have started to get use to coming in and on some weeks, I come in on days when we are not expected to be in the office.

<br><br>

<b>Structure!</b> - As an Independent Consultant, you are your own boss and you tend to be able to just focus on the project you are working on.  As a full time employee of Microsoft, I not only have to focus on doing a good job but I have to also focus on Career Development, All-Hand's Meetings, Networking and One on Ones with Mentors and Managers.

<br><br>

Even when you are at a consulting company, you tended to only focus on your client and you only dealt with your consulting company if you were trying to move up the ladder or there were mandatory company-wide meetings (which are very few).  This aspect of Microsoft (or just being a full time employee in general at a large company) has been something that I have had a hard time adjusting too at times.

<br><br>

<strong>Misc. Observations!</strong>

<br><br>

<b>Travel Days!</b> - Typically at most companies, you will travel on Sunday and work 10 hours days to leave on Thursday (<i>gotta get those 40 hours in!</i>) or leave late Friday night.  In CSE (maybe all of Microsoft), Monday and Friday are considered <i>travel days</i>.   On those days the only expectaction is that you are traveling as they do not want you traveling on the weekends.

<br><br>

If you do happen to travel during a weekend, CSE (maybe all of Microsoft) has an informal policy that you can get those days back as vacation days.  When our team went to Germany a few months ago (my first time out of the continental United States), we traveled on the weekened and a few weeks later, we were given those days back as vacation the week of Easter Sunday. 

<b>Polls Polls Polls (Steve Balmer voice)!</b> - Similar to their love of Developers, Developers, Developers, one thing I have learned about Microsoft is they really love to do Polls.  You will have a poll for onboarding, you will have polls when you do Offsite Events, there is the annual company-wide MSPoll Poll and team-specific polls like Core Service Engineering (Internal IT for Microsoft).  What this tells me is that Microsoft seems to really care about what their employees think, this is why they are always collecting data.
