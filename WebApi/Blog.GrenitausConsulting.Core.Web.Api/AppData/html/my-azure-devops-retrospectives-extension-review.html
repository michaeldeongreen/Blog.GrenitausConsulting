Recently, I was asked by the the Tech Lead of a project that our team just recently wrapped up here at Microsoft to MC the final Sprint Retrospective.  The Sprint Retrospective would include both the Microsoft Staff and Client Partner Staff, whom we assisted in implemetning various backend components in the Azure Cloud.

<br><br>

As an engineer who is both a [LINK]PMP[/LINK] and a [LINK]SCRUM Master[/LINK], I have taken part in many Sprint Retrospectives but I have never been asked to facilitate one.  I wanted to find a tool that was easy to use, interactive and if possible, could be used in [LINK]Azure DevOps[/LINK].  After doing some research, I found a Azure DevOps Extension that met all of my criteria.  In this blog I want to write a review of the Azure DevOps [LINK]Retrospectives[/LINK] extension.
