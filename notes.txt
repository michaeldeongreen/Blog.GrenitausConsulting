TODO Later:
*Can you put things in .json and pull out and set to variables like api url

2) Research why certain characters like # crash web api
4) Maybe a back button at bottom of post
* See if you can get the links to move you up to top elegantly
*Possible timer like dachecache to refresh memory
*facebook comment section
	https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/comments/
	
*Implement meta service in all pages where necessary
	
*Make ico for page, it has angular logo now
