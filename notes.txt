TODO Later:
*Can you put things in .json and pull out and set to variables like api url

2) Research why certain characters like # crash web api
4) Maybe a back button at bottom of post
* See if you can get the links to move you up to top elegantly
*Possible timer like dachecache to refresh memory
*facebook comment section
	https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/comments/
	
*Implement meta service in all pages where necessary
	
*Make ico for page, it has angular logo now

gc-cli
talk about release process and the shadow blog

how much time:
according to github first checkin was 12 days until prod release


* Try to see if this allows api/web to be hosted together
	<add input="{REQUEST_URI}" matchType="Pattern" pattern="^/api/.*$" ignoreCase="true" negate="true" />
Try this too:

improvements
reload data per request on dev
comments section
add logging to core cli

* -prod <----You don't need this anymore because the parameters will be provided now
* -url/u ---Url to use for the blog
* -config/c ---Directory where json config files are located
* -static/s ---Directory where static pages should be outputed
* -output/o ---Directory where you will output files
* Remove the AngularCLI location, it is a dupe of the output
