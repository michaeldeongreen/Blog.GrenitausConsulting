3) Upgraded from Angular 2 to Angular 4

Issues:
	@nglibs/meta had issues.  I had to remove the below services that used them and excluded SeoService from the project:
	1) SeoService
	2) MetaService
	
	To be able to use the MetaService, I had to:
	1) Upgrade @nglibs/meta to the version that uses angular 4
