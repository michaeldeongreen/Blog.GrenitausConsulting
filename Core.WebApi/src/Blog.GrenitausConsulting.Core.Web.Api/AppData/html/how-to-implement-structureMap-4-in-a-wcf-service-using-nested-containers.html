I recently created a proof of concept GitHub repository and GitHub Gist on how to implement StructureMap 4 in a WCF Service using Nested Containers for a client who deals with lots of legacy code.  A good portion of the code came from <a href="https://lostechies.com/jimmybogard/2008/07/30/integrating-structuremap-with-wcf/" target="_blank">Jimmy Bogard's blog</a> and he does a great job of explaining the purpose of each class.  
<br><br>
I built upon his example to use the latest version of StructureMap, which is currently Version 4 and implemented Nested Containers per Operation Request.  The GitHub Repository should be fairly straightforward to follow and I have also created a GitHub Gist to point out the bare minimum classes that I used to accomplish this task.
