This blog entry is a follow up to my <a href="http://blog.grenitausconsulting.com/post/how-to-setup-continuous-intergration-and-continuous-deployment-for-a-angular-5-application-using-azure-devops" target="_blank">previous</a> post explaining how
to setup continuous integration and continuous deploying for a Angular 5 application using Azure Devops.  In the previous blog, I used <a href="http://grenitausconsulting.com" target="_blank">GrenitausConsulting.com</a> as the example.  In this blog post
I will walk you through how I setup continuous integration and continuous for <a href="http://blog.grenitausconsulting.com" target="_blank">blog.grenitausconsulting.com</a> using Azure Devops, which was much more complicated.

<br><br>

<strong>Caveats!</strong>

<br><br>

First, if you are not familiar with the design of <a href="http://blog.grenitausconsulting.com" target="_blank">blog.grenitausconsulting.com</a>, I suggest you read the <a href="http://blog.grenitausconsulting.com/post/replacing-my-wordpress-blog-with-angular-2-and-asp-net-web-api-part-1" target="_blank">3 part series</a> I wrote, explaining all of the components before reading this blog entry.
Also, if you are not familiar with Azure DevOps, please look at my <a href="http://blog.grenitausconsulting.com/post/how-to-setup-continuous-intergration-and-continuous-deployment-for-a-angular-5-application-using-azure-devops" target="_blank">previous blog</a> for details.

<br><br>

Also, I assume that you are familiar with:

<br><br>

<ul>
    <li>Angular 5+</li>
	<li>angular-cli</li>
	<li>.Net Core</li>
	<li>Azure Portal</li>
	<li>GitHub</li>
	<li>Node Package Manager</li>	
</ul>

<br><br>

<strong>Challenges!</strong>

<br><br>

<a href="http://blog.grenitausconsulting.com" target="_blank">blog.grenitausconsulting.com</a> has 3 basic components:

<br><br>

<ul>
    <li>Angular 5 Front-End</li> - Web Client that serves up blog pages.
	<li>ASP.Net Core REST API</li> - Back-end Server that exposes an API that serves up blog data.
	<li>gc-cli</li> - Command Line Interface used to generate sitemaps, rss feeds and static web pages to assist with SEO.
</ul>

<a href="assets/images/replacing-my-wordpress-blog-with-angular-2-and-asp-net-web-api-part-1-002.png"><img class="img-responsive" src="assets/images/replacing-my-wordpress-blog-with-angular-2-and-asp-net-web-api-part-1-002.png" alt="Grenitaus Consulting"></a>

<br><br>

When I created the blogging software, I was in a bit of a hurry and since I don't have an SSL Certificate, I never made an Admin Page.  So to add a new blog, tag, quote etc etc, the steps are:

<ul>
	<li>1 - Update JSON Config Files in the Visual Studio Project with new Blog, Tags, Quotes</li>
	<li>2 - Run gc-cli, which will look at the JSON Config Files and generate sitemap, rss and static pages for angular-cli to add to the "dist" folder</li>
	<li>3 - Build and Publish REST API</li>
	<li>4 - Build and Publish Angular Application</li>
	<li>5 - FTP the published files to Azure</li>
</ul>

<br><br>

Steps 1-4 are automated via Bash Script but Step 5, I do manually.

<br><br>

So the first item I had to take care of is modifying gc-cli to be 100% command line driven.  Prior to making the changes, gc-cli accepted 2 arguments, build and what environment ie "gc-cli.exe build -prod".  It would use the 
environment argument to determine which appsettings.json file to use ie "appsetttings.Development.json" or "appsetttings.Production.json".  

<br /><br />

The appsettings.json files tell gc-cli what REST API url to use, where REST API JSON
Config files are located and where to output static pages, sitemap and rss information.  Now, I wanted to make gc-cli more cloud native by having these values passed in as parameters.

<br><br>

Also, I when gc-cli wants to display information to the console, I used the Console object but decided to swap it out for ILogger and write to the Console in Azure DevOps.  You can view my gc-cli code <a href="https://github.com/michaeldeongreen/Blog.GrenitausConsulting/tree/master/Core.cli/src" target="_blank">here</a>.

<br><br>

<strong>Azure DevOps!</strong>

<br><br>

Once I made the necessary changes to gc-cli, I was basically ready to setup my Azure Devops Project.  I created my new Project, setup my GitHub connection and now I am ready to configure my Azure DevOps Build Agent.

<br><br>

First, I needed to Build gc-cli.  So I chose a .NET Core Task:

<br><br>

<a href="assets/images/automate-the-deployment-of-my-azure-hosted-blog-using-azure-devops-001.png"><img class="img-responsive" src="assets/images/automate-the-deployment-of-my-azure-hosted-blog-using-azure-devops-001.png" alt="Grenitaus Consulting"></a>

<br><br>

Next, I needed to build my REST API. So, I chose a .NET Core Task:

<br><br>

<a href="assets/images/automate-the-deployment-of-my-azure-hosted-blog-using-azure-devops-002.png"><img class="img-responsive" src="assets/images/automate-the-deployment-of-my-azure-hosted-blog-using-azure-devops-002.png" alt="Grenitaus Consulting"></a>

<br><br>

After this was done, I needed to run my Unit Tests.  So, I chose a .NET Core Task: 

<br><br>

<a href="assets/images/automate-the-deployment-of-my-azure-hosted-blog-using-azure-devops-003.png"><img class="img-responsive" src="assets/images/automate-the-deployment-of-my-azure-hosted-blog-using-azure-devops-003.png" alt="Grenitaus Consulting"></a>

<br><br>

Once this has been done, I needed to created a gc-cli executable as by default a .NET Core Console application creates a DLL.  So again, I created a .NET Core Task:

<br><br>

<a href="assets/images/automate-the-deployment-of-my-azure-hosted-blog-using-azure-devops-004.png"><img class="img-responsive" src="assets/images/automate-the-deployment-of-my-azure-hosted-blog-using-azure-devops-004.png" alt="Grenitaus Consulting"></a>

<br><br>

Once the gc-cli Executable had been created, I needed to create Variables for Command Line Arguments.  I did this by going to the Variables tab:

<br><br>

<a href="assets/images/automate-the-deployment-of-my-azure-hosted-blog-using-azure-devops-005.png"><img class="img-responsive" src="assets/images/automate-the-deployment-of-my-azure-hosted-blog-using-azure-devops-005.png" alt="Grenitaus Consulting"></a>

<br><br>

Next, I created a Command Line Task so I can call gc-cli and pass the Variables as parameters:

<br><br>

<a href="assets/images/automate-the-deployment-of-my-azure-hosted-blog-using-azure-devops-006.png"><img class="img-responsive" src="assets/images/automate-the-deployment-of-my-azure-hosted-blog-using-azure-devops-006.png" alt="Grenitaus Consulting"></a>

<br><br>

Next, I needed to restore node package dependencies for the Client.  To do this, I created a npm Task:

<br><br>

<a href="assets/images/automate-the-deployment-of-my-azure-hosted-blog-using-azure-devops-007.png"><img class="img-responsive" src="assets/images/automate-the-deployment-of-my-azure-hosted-blog-using-azure-devops-007.png" alt="Grenitaus Consulting"></a>

<br><br>

After this is done, it is time to build the Angular 5 Client and create the publish files.  Again, I created a Command Line Task:

<br><br>

<a href="assets/images/automate-the-deployment-of-my-azure-hosted-blog-using-azure-devops-008.png"><img class="img-responsive" src="assets/images/automate-the-deployment-of-my-azure-hosted-blog-using-azure-devops-008.png" alt="Grenitaus Consulting"></a>

<br><br>

Now it is time to publish the REST API files.  I use a .NET Core Task to accomplish this:

<br><br>

<a href="assets/images/automate-the-deployment-of-my-azure-hosted-blog-using-azure-devops-009.png"><img class="img-responsive" src="assets/images/automate-the-deployment-of-my-azure-hosted-blog-using-azure-devops-009.png" alt="Grenitaus Consulting"></a>

<br><br>

Now it is time to start publishing to Azure.  However, when I used an Azure App Service Deploy Task, I would get an error like:

<br><br>

<a href="assets/images/automate-the-deployment-of-my-azure-hosted-blog-using-azure-devops-010.png"><img class="img-responsive" src="assets/images/automate-the-deployment-of-my-azure-hosted-blog-using-azure-devops-010.png" alt="Grenitaus Consulting"></a>

<br><br>

What I realized is that I needed to Stop the App Service before I deployed the App Service.  To do this, I created a Azure App Service Manage Task:

<br><br>

<a href="assets/images/automate-the-deployment-of-my-azure-hosted-blog-using-azure-devops-011.png"><img class="img-responsive" src="assets/images/automate-the-deployment-of-my-azure-hosted-blog-using-azure-devops-011.png" alt="Grenitaus Consulting"></a>

<br><br>

Now that I have the App Service stopped, I can deploy and I do that with a Azure App Service Deploy Task:

<br><br>

<a href="assets/images/automate-the-deployment-of-my-azure-hosted-blog-using-azure-devops-012.png"><img class="img-responsive" src="assets/images/automate-the-deployment-of-my-azure-hosted-blog-using-azure-devops-012.png" alt="Grenitaus Consulting"></a>

<br><br>

After the App Service is deployed, I need to restart the App Service and I did this by making a Azure App Service Manage:

<br><br>

<a href="assets/images/automate-the-deployment-of-my-azure-hosted-blog-using-azure-devops-013.png"><img class="img-responsive" src="assets/images/automate-the-deployment-of-my-azure-hosted-blog-using-azure-devops-013.png" alt="Grenitaus Consulting"></a>

Next, I need to do the same exact steps for the Angular 5 Application ie Stop Service, Deploy Service and Restart Service:

<br><br>

<a href="assets/images/automate-the-deployment-of-my-azure-hosted-blog-using-azure-devops-014.png"><img class="img-responsive" src="assets/images/automate-the-deployment-of-my-azure-hosted-blog-using-azure-devops-014.png" alt="Grenitaus Consulting"></a>

<br><br>

<a href="assets/images/automate-the-deployment-of-my-azure-hosted-blog-using-azure-devops-015.png"><img class="img-responsive" src="assets/images/automate-the-deployment-of-my-azure-hosted-blog-using-azure-devops-015.png" alt="Grenitaus Consulting"></a>

<br><br>

<a href="assets/images/automate-the-deployment-of-my-azure-hosted-blog-using-azure-devops-016.png"><img class="img-responsive" src="assets/images/automate-the-deployment-of-my-azure-hosted-blog-using-azure-devops-016.png" alt="Grenitaus Consulting"></a>

<br><br>

Last, I need to Trigger CI & CD on check-in to the master branch and enable continuous integration:

<br><br>

<a href="assets/images/automate-the-deployment-of-my-azure-hosted-blog-using-azure-devops-017.png"><img class="img-responsive" src="assets/images/automate-the-deployment-of-my-azure-hosted-blog-using-azure-devops-017.png" alt="Grenitaus Consulting"></a>
